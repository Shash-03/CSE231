## About CSE231
CSE231: Operating Systems is a 2xx-level course offered to undergrads pursuing the CSE and CS+X disciplines at IIIT-Delhi. The course centers around exposing students to the underlying concepts and principles of operating systems. It aims to enable students to:

* understand the fundamental principles and approaches behind process Synchronizations, Deadlock Avoidance, Memory Management, etc.
* write a Shell with complete clarity about process creation and execution
* write multi-threaded applications with synchronization primitives and to analyze effects of concurrency on process execution and correctness
* analyze the impact of OS concepts like Virtual Memory, Concurrency, etc. on program execution and to fine-tune the program to run efficiently on any OS
