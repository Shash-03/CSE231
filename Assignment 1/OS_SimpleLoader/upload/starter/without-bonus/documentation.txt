Line 1-6: 
Declares 3 variables: 2 pointers pointing to struct ELF Header and struct ELF Program Header and an integer to store the file descriptor

Line 7-19: 
Declares the cleanup function which makes sure that it frees up the memory allocated to the variables

Line 20-22:
Stores the content of the file into the file descriptor 

Line 23-27:
Checks if the value of the file descriptor is valid

Line 28-30:
Reads the relevant data from the file descriptor into the memory address pointed towards by the edhr pointers

Line 31-35:
Checks if the data was read properly

Line 36-38:
Stores the entry point address into a variable called counter

Line 39-53:
Runs a while loop to iterate through the program headers to search for the header with the p_type attribute equal to PT_LOAD
and making sure that the entry point lies in the segment with the p_type attribute equal to PT_LOAD

Line 54-61:
Declares a pointer which points towards the memory mapping from the offset equivalent to the value of p_offset with the size of p_memsz

Line 62-70:
Typecasts the required memory address into the same type as _start
Stores the value of _start in result and prints result
